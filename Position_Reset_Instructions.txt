PERIL GAME POSITION RESET KIT
=============================

If your leaderboard, scoreboard, or dice display gets knocked out of position, 
use this simple tool to recalibrate them.

WHAT'S INCLUDED:
- Position_Reset_Tool.lsl (temporary calibration script)
- config (updated configuration notecard)

HOW TO RECALIBRATE POSITIONS:
============================

1. POSITION YOUR DISPLAYS
   - Move each display object to where you want it positioned
   - Make sure they're all within 20 meters of the controller

2. DROP RESET TOOL IN CONTROLLER
   - Put Position_Reset_Tool.lsl into your controller object
   
3. SCAN POSITIONS
   - Click the controller object
   - It will scan and give you new config values like:
     scoreboard_offset=<1.234, 5.678, 0.000>
     leaderboard_offset=<-2.345, 0.000, 1.500>
     dice_offset=<3.456, 0.000, 0.000>
   
4. UPDATE CONFIG NOTECARDS
   - Edit the "config" notecard in each display object
   - Replace the old offset values with the new ones
   - Save the notecard
   
5. CLEAN UP
   - Remove Position_Reset_Tool.lsl from your controller
   - Your displays will automatically move to the new positions!

EXAMPLE:
=======
If the reset tool says:
scoreboard_offset=<0.500, 2.800, 0.100>

Then in your scoreboard's config notecard, change:
scoreboard_offset=<0.000, 3.000, 0.000>
to:
scoreboard_offset=<0.500, 2.800, 0.100>

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============
- Make sure displays are within 20 meters during scanning
- The config notecard must be named exactly "config" (lowercase)
- After editing config, the objects should move automatically
- If they don't move, try resetting the display objects

That's it! No script editing required - just update the config values!
