  - **Clean Production Mode**: When disabled, only essential error messages and public announcements remain
  - **Full Debug Visibility**: When enabled, shows internal operations, sync messages, state changes, and diagnostic info

### 🔧 **Disconnect/Reconnect Recovery System**
- **Smart Player Return Detection**: Fixed major issue where disconnected players couldn't resume their turn
  - **Issue**: Players who disconnected during number picking (like Nooser) would get wrong menu when returning
  - **Before**: Disconnect → Return → Ready menu shown → Required kick to continue game
  - **After**: Disconnect → Return → "Welcome back! Restoring your number picking dialog..." → Game continues normally
- **Enhanced State Recovery**: Automatic detection and repair of corrupted game state from disconnections
  - Compares expected picker (from pick queue) with current picker state
  - Automatically fixes `currentPicker` corruption when players reconnect
  - Works for both number picking and dice rolling phases
- **Owner Emergency Recovery**: If game gets completely stuck, owner can touch board to force-resume
- **Debug Visibility**: Verbose logging shows state detection and recovery actions for troubleshooting

### 🎯 **Number Picker Dialog Protection System**
- **Stale Dialog Prevention**: Enhanced dialog validation to prevent outdated number selections
  - **Protection Against**: Players clicking cached dialog buttons after game state changed

  - **Smart Filtering**: Automatically rejects selections for numbers already picked by others
- **Enhanced Dialog Recovery**: Improved system for restoring number picking dialogs after disconnections
- **Session Management**: Better tracking of active dialog sessions to prevent conflicts

### 🔍 **Number Detection & Shield Logic Fixes**
- **Fixed "Numbers Not Showing" Issue**: Resolved major bug where system couldn't see numbers players had picked

  - **Root Cause**: Pick data synchronization issues between modules causing invisible player selections
  - **Solution**: Enhanced pick data validation and sync message reliability across all game modules
  - **Impact**: Shield detection now works correctly - proper "PLOT TWIST!" and shield mechanics restored

### 🛡️ **Game State Desynchronization Fixes**

## [2.8.3] - 2025-09-01

### 🚨 **CRITICAL BUG FIXES** - Major Game Logic Issues Resolved

#### 🛡️ **Shield Detection Logic Fixed**
- **MAJOR BUG FIX**: Corrected shield detection that was incorrectly reporting "NO SHIELD!" when players had picked the rolled number
  - **Issue**: Game said "Nobody picked 1" even when Rebecca had picked "3, 1" - Taylor should have been shielded but took damage instead
  - **Root Cause**: Shield detection was checking if ONLY the peril player picked the number instead of checking if ANYONE picked it
  - **Fix**: Shield detection now correctly uses `matched` flag (anyone picked) instead of `perilPickedIt` flag (only peril player picked)
  - **Impact**: Players will no longer take undeserved damage when others provide proper shields
  - **Logic Update**: 
    - ✅ **NO SHIELD**: Only when nobody picked the rolled number (`!matched`)
    - ✅ **DIRECT HIT**: When peril player picked their own doom (`matched && perilPickedIt`)
    - ✅ **PLOT TWIST**: When someone else picked it but not peril player (handled upstream)

#### 🎯 **Initialization System Overhaul**
- **MAJOR BUG FIX**: Complete fix for "can't join after rez" issue that required manual script reset
  - **Issue**: When rezzing game from inventory, players couldn't join until all scripts were manually reset
  - **Root Cause**: Critical scripts weren't properly resetting their state variables on rez, causing stale data conflicts
  - **Scripts Fixed**: Added comprehensive `on_rez()` handlers to all critical game scripts:
    - 🎯 **Game_Manager.lsl**: Core game logic and state management (20+ variables reset)
    - 🎲 **Roll_ConfettiModule.lsl**: Dice rolling and shield detection logic
    - 🎮 **NumberPicker_DialogHandler.lsl**: Player number selection dialogs
    - 🤖 **Bot_Manager.lsl**: Bot player automation and picking logic
    - 📦 **Floater_Manager.lsl**: Player status floating displays
    - 🎭 **Player_DialogHandler.lsl**: Player and owner menu systems
    - 🧮 **Game_Calculator.lsl**: Dice type and pick requirement calculations
  - **Each Fix Includes**:
    - ✅ Complete state variable reset to initial values
    - ✅ Dynamic channel re-initialization for unique instance communication
    - ✅ Old listener cleanup and fresh listener setup
    - ✅ Stale game data clearing (picks, player lists, dialog sessions)
    - ✅ Critical flag reinitialization (roundStarted, rollInProgress, etc.)
  - **Impact**: **Game is now immediately ready for players after rezzing - NO manual script reset required!**

### 🎮 **Player Experience Improvements**
