## 🎲 **DICE SCALING SYSTEM**

The game automatically selects appropriate dice to ensure fair gameplay:

|------------------|-----------|----------------------|
| 1-2 players | **d6** | 6 numbers (1-6) |
| 3-4 players | **d12** | 12 numbers (1-12) |
| 5-6 players | **d20** | 20 numbers (1-20) |

## 🎭 **DRAMATIC ANNOUNCEMENTS**

The game features thematic messaging for maximum immersion:

## 🎯 **STRATEGY TIPS**

### **As a Regular Player:**
- **Pick popular numbers** (5, 6, 7) to increase chances of causing Plot Twists
- **Avoid number 1** - statistically less likely on higher dice
- **Watch the Peril Player's lives** - affects how many numbers you must pick

### **As the Peril Player:**
- **Avoid common/popular numbers** that others might pick
- **Pick edge numbers** (1, maximum die value) for better survival odds
- **Remember**: The more lives you have, the fewer numbers others pick (easier to avoid)

### **Advanced Tactics:**
- **Psychological warfare** - discuss picks to influence others
- **Alliance forming** - temporary cooperation to eliminate threats
- **Risk assessment** - calculate odds based on remaining numbers
