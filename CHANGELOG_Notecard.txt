🧠 MEMORY OPTIMIZATION & DEAD CODE CLEANUP
- UpdateHelper.lsl Elimination: Completely removed vestigial UpdateHelper script that was consuming memory but providing no functionality
  * Issue: 204-line script existed but was never actually called - pure dead code consuming ~41KB memory
  * Fix: Removed UpdateHelper.lsl file and all supporting infrastructure from Main Controller
  * Memory Impact: Main Controller memory usage improved from ~83.8% to 81.4% (2.4 percentage point reduction)
  * Cleaned Up: updateNewPlayer() function, UpdateHelper message constants, variables, and handlers
  * Simplified: updateHelpers() function now performs direct scoreboard updates without delegation
- Verbose_Logger Simplification: Streamlined debug logging system by removing unused buffering infrastructure

  * Size Reduction: Simplified from 149 lines to 80 lines (~47% smaller)
  * Kept: Essential debug toggle functionality and system-wide logging coordination
  * Performance: Eliminated timer overhead and reduced message processing complexity

🎨 BOT PROFILE PICTURE FIX
- Fixed Bot Visual Glitch: Resolved issue where bot profile pictures would randomly turn into gray boxes mid-game
  * Issue: During scoreboard refresh (e.g., player removal), all profiles were reset to default gray texture before restoration
  * Root Cause: refreshPlayerDisplay() function reset ALL profile prims to default, causing visual flicker
  * Fix: Modified refresh logic to only reset unused player slots, preserving active player textures
  * Enhanced Caching: Bots now store TEXTURE_BOT_PROFILE directly in cache to prevent HTTP requests
  * Result: Bot avatars maintain consistent robot icon throughout entire game without gray box flicker

🚨 CRITICAL BUG FIXES - Major Game Logic Issues Resolved

🛡️ SHIELD DETECTION LOGIC FIXED
- MAJOR BUG FIX: Corrected shield detection that was incorrectly reporting "NO SHIELD!" when players had picked the rolled number
  * Issue: Game said "Nobody picked 1" even when Rebecca had picked "3, 1" - Taylor should have been shielded but took damage instead
  * Root Cause: Shield detection was checking if ONLY the peril player picked the number instead of checking if ANYONE picked it

🎯 INITIALIZATION SYSTEM OVERHAUL
- MAJOR BUG FIX: Complete fix for "can't join after rez" issue that required manual script reset
  * Issue: When rezzing game from inventory, players couldn't join until all scripts were manually reset
  * Root Cause: Critical scripts weren't properly resetting their state variables on rez, causing stale data conflicts
  * Scripts Fixed: Added comprehensive on_rez() handlers to all critical game scripts:
    - 🎯 Game_Manager.lsl: Core game logic and state management (20+ variables reset)
    - 🎲 Roll_ConfettiModule.lsl: Dice rolling and shield detection logic
    - 🎮 NumberPicker_DialogHandler.lsl: Player number selection dialogs
    - 🤖 Bot_Manager.lsl: Bot player automation and picking logic
    - 📦 Floater_Manager.lsl: Player status floating displays
    - 🎭 Player_DialogHandler.lsl: Player and owner menu systems
    - 🧮 Game_Calculator.lsl: Dice type and pick requirement calculations

    - ✅ Complete state variable reset to initial values
    - ✅ Dynamic channel re-initialization for unique instance communication
    - ✅ Old listener cleanup and fresh listener setup
    - ✅ Stale game data clearing (picks, player lists, dialog sessions)
    - ✅ Critical flag reinitialization (roundStarted, rollInProgress, etc.)
  * Impact: **Game is now immediately ready for players after rezzing - NO manual script reset required!**
