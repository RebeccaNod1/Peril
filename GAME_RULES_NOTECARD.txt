===============================================================================

OBJECTIVE
Be the last player standing! Survive the deadly dice rolls while others fall 
to elimination. Only one can claim Ultimate Victory!

===============================================================================

SETUP

Players:
- 2-10 players can join the game
- Bots available for testing and variety
- Owner participation - game owner can play too!

Starting Conditions:
- Each player begins with 3 lives (hearts)
- One player is randomly selected as the Peril Player
- Dice type automatically chosen based on player count

===============================================================================

GAMEPLAY PHASES

1. Ready Phase
- All players (except game starter) must mark themselves "Ready"
- Game starter can begin once everyone is prepared
- No joining allowed once the killing game begins!

2. Number Picking Phase
Players pick numbers based on the Peril Player's remaining lives:

| Peril Player's Lives | Numbers Each Player Must Pick |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| 3 lives             | 1 number                      |
| 2 lives             | 2 numbers                     |
| 1 life              | 3 numbers                     |

Picking Order:
1. Peril Player picks first
2. All other players pick in sequence
3. No duplicate picks - each number can only be chosen once per round

3. Dice Rolling Phase
- Peril Player rolls the dice
- Result determines everyone's fate!
- Roll is displayed on the game board for all to see

4. Resolution Phase
Three possible outcomes based on the dice roll:

PLOT TWIST!
- Someone OTHER than the Peril Player picked the rolled number
- That player becomes the new Peril Player
- No lives lost this round
- Game continues with new Peril Player

DIRECT HIT!
- The Peril Player picked their own rolled number
- Peril Player loses 1 life
- If they survive, they remain the Peril Player for next round

NO SHIELD!
- Nobody picked the rolled number
- Peril Player loses 1 life
- No protection from other players' picks

5. Elimination
- Players with 0 lives are eliminated from the game
- Eliminated players cannot return
- Game continues with remaining survivors

6. Victory
- Last player standing wins!
- Victory celebration with confetti effects!
- Winner's name recorded on the leaderboard

DICE SCALING SYSTEM

The game automatically selects appropriate dice to ensure fair gameplay:

| Number of Players | Dice Type | Total Numbers Available |
|------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| 1-2 players      | d6        | 6 numbers (1-6)        |
| 3-4 players      | d12       | 12 numbers (1-12)      |
| 5-6 players      | d20       | 20 numbers (1-20)      |
| 7-10 players     | d30       | 30 numbers (1-30)      |

This ensures exactly 3 numbers per player are always available

===============================================================================

DRAMATIC ANNOUNCEMENTS

The game features thematic messaging for maximum immersion:

- "[Player] has entered the deadly game! Welcome to your potential doom!"
