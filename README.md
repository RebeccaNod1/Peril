🎲 PERIL DICE – GAME RULES
🧍 Objective:
Avoid becoming the “person in peril” and losing all your lives.
The last player with lives remaining wins!

🛠️ Setup
Each player wears a Peril Dice Tracker HUD

Everyone starts with 3 lives

Choose a dice type: d6, d12, or d20

One player clicks "Set Yourself In Peril" on the HUD to start

🔁 Game Rounds
1. Determine Lives of Person in Peril

3 Lives → Each player picks 1 number

2 Lives → Each player picks 2 numbers

1 Life → Each player picks 3 numbers

2. Players Pick Numbers
Everyone (including the player in peril) picks their numbers from the die range.
Example: On a d12 with 2 lives in peril → pick 2 numbers between 1–12.

3. Roll the Die
Use a real or scripted dice object in SL to roll (matching your chosen type).

🎯 Check the Result
If the roll matches another player's pick →
That player becomes the new person in peril

If the roll matches no one, or the peril player’s own pick →
The peril player loses 1 life and stays in peril

💀 Elimination
When a player reaches 0 lives, they're eliminated from the game.

🏆 Winning the Game
The last remaining player with lives wins!

✅ Game Example
4 players, using a d12

Alice is in peril with 2 lives

Everyone picks 2 numbers:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Bob:   3, 7  
Carol: 6, 11  
Dave:  2, 9  
Alice: 1, 12
🎲 Roll = 6 → Carol becomes the new person in peril

📟 PERIL DICE TRACKER HUD GUIDE
Touch the tracker to access the menu:

🔘 Set Dice
Pick d6, d12, or d20 — defines the range of possible numbers.

🔘 Pick Numbers
Lets you pick numbers (based on how many the current person in peril is allowed).
Your picks are shown in the floating text.

🔘 Set Yourself in Peril
Marks you as the current player in peril. Everyone’s HUD will update with your name and lives.

🔘 Lose Life / Reset Lives
Used only by the wearer of the HUD to manage their own lives.
If you’re the player in peril, everyone else will see your life change reflected in their menus.

🧠 Odds of Rolling a Specific Number
Here’s the chance of any one number being rolled:

Dice    Total Sides    % Chance per Number
d6    6    16.7%
d12    12    8.3%
d20    20    5.0%

The more numbers you can pick, the better your odds — but lives are limited!
